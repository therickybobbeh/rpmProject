# Notes about using code from sources
You may not under any circumstances copy any code from any current or former student in the class, or from any public
project addressing the same content as the course projects, such as the Raven’s Progressive Matrices or a Block World
agent.
The only code segments you are permitted to borrow are isolated project-agnostic functions, meaning functions which
serve a purpose that makes sense outside the context of our projects (such as, for example, inverting colors in an
image). Include a link to the original source of the code and clearly note where the copied code begins and ends (for
example, with /* BEGIN CODE FROM (source link) */ before and /* END CODE FROM (source link) */ after the copied code).
This is partially to emphasize what your unique project and deliverable is, and partially to protect against instances
where you and a classmate both borrowed a function from the same external repository. Note that annotating and
attributing code is far easier than asking a TA if you need to attribute—if you need to ask, attribute it.
